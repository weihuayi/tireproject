	abstract = {The aim of this study is to investigate the thermal evolution of an aircraft tire rolling at high velocities up to take off values. As this kind of experiment is difﬁcult to realize on a real runway, experimental tests were realized on aircraft tires rolling on a steel drum. The rotating drum facility allows to apply variable velocities beyond the take off limits, at ﬁxed skidding angles and loadings. The rolling conditions, vertical loading, velocity and cornering conditions were adopted to correspond to the real conditions of an aircraft tire running or skidding on a ﬂat runway. In the experimental part, the inﬂuence of skidding angle, velocity and loading on the thermal evolution of the tire tread were investigated. The thermo-mechanical ﬁnite element analysis of a pneumatic radial tire structure was performed taking into account the hyper-viscoelastic rubber behavior, with heating mechanisms developed by the inelastic deformation and by friction. Three-dimensional ﬁnite element simulations of an aircraft tire rolling on a steel drum were carried out using Abaqus/Standard ﬁnite element solver. The comparison of the temperature distribution on the tire tread between numerical results and the experimental data shows the same overall tendencies. The good correlation between numerical and experimental data shows that numerical simulation could predict the thermal evolution of the tire in critical situations. The authors would like to mention that for conﬁdentiality reason, certain numerical data could not be revealed.},

	abstract = {The standing wave phenomenon of radial tire occurs when the vehicle speed reaches a certain critical value, this phenomenon can easily result in traffic accidents. In this paper, it completed numerical simulation analysis of standing wave border speed about 195/60R15 radial tire by use of ABAQUS finite element analysis software, and determined characterization methods of standing wave border speed about radial tire, and then realized the experimental verification by use of a test system. Based on these, it concludes that those measures to advance the tire pressure and reduce the tire load can increase the border speed value of standing wave effectively, which not only presents border speed indicators for the safe driving of vehicle, but also provides a scientific basis for the design and manufacture of tire that is able to resist high speed and traffic management.},

	abstract = {Hydroplaning is a major cause of wet-road accidents. The main contact element between the ground and vehicle is the tire. Tire safety and performance are therefore critically important. Wet roads present several uncontrollable factors. This paper uses CFD (Computational Fluid Dynamics) to analyze wet road hydroplaning effects. Fluid dynamics cannot be easily measured using normal experiments. Therefore the braking distance and record rolling vary by encoder. We propose another method to analysis it. By this result, the large groove and tire depth can reduce hydroplaning effects. A second method is modifying the tire void pattern which can reduce the hydroplaning extent by 29\%.},

	abstract = {The compaction and stress generation on terrain were always investigated based on empirical approaches or testing methods for tire/soil interaction. However, the analysis should be performed for various tires and at different soil strengths. With the increasing capacity of numerical computers and simulation software, finite element modeling of tire/terrain interaction seems a good approach for predicting the effect of change on the parameters. In this work, an elaborated 3D model fully complianning with the geometry of radial tire 115/60R13 was established, using commercial code Solidwork Simulation. The hyper­elastic and incompressible rubber as tire main material was analyzed by Moony­Rivlin model. The Drucker­Prager yield criterion was used to model the soil compaction. Results show that the model realistically predicts the laboratory tests outputs of the modeled tire on the soft soil.},

	abstract = {The contribution has its focus on several aspects of the description of tire features through finite element modeling. It is starting with the formulation of rubber material properties. Material characteristics, which have to be taken into account depending on the focus of analysis, are introduced. Geometrical nonlinearities, i.e. large strain, nonlinear elasticity, softening, inelastic and dissipative features are of importance and influence certain tire properties. An important simulation feature is the steady state rolling framework. In this case, the finite element discretization is fixed in space and the material is considered as flowing through the mesh. This approach is computationally very efficient and represents the real loading conditions of the tire. During the design process, various structural aspects need to be investigated in order to obtain an optimal product. Tire mechanical properties which are in the reach of current computing facilities are shown.},
